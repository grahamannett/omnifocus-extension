# OmniFocus Extension

A browser extension for Chrome-based browsers that adds a button to save the current tab to your OmniFocus inbox.

While there is another extension that does this: https://github.com/gligoran/save-to-omnifocus
That extension is not the latest manifest version and also leaves a new tab open when the button is clicked.

Would like to try out adding window.ai to this extension as well.
