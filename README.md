# OmniFocus Extension

![icon](./icons/icon.png)

A browser extension for Chrome-based browsers that adds a button to save the current tab to your OmniFocus inbox. When Chrome AI is available, it automatically includes a one-line summary of the page content.

While there is another extension that does this: https://github.com/gligoran/save-to-omnifocus
That extension is not the latest manifest version and also leaves a new tab open when the button is clicked.

## Setup

Some of these features are currently still experimental and may require additional setup in chrome,

- [chrome://flags/#text-safety-classifier](chrome://flags/#text-safety-classifier) - disable this as otherwise everything is blocked
- [Optimization Guide On Device Model](chrome://flags/#optimization-guide-on-device-model) - Enable this
- Enable the following flags:
  - [Prompt API for Gemini Nano](chrome://flags/#prompt-api-for-gemini-nano)
  - [Summarization API](chrome://flags/#summarization-api-for-gemini-nano)

## Features

- Adds the current tab's title and URL to your OmniFocus inbox with one click
- Supports both direct adding and popup interface
- Automatically includes AI-generated summary when Chrome AI is available

## AI Summarization

This extension supports Chrome's AI features to generate a one-line summary of web pages:

- When Chrome AI is available, the extension automatically generates a summary of the current page
- The summary is included in the OmniFocus note field along with the URL
- The popup interface shows whether AI summarization is available
- If AI is not available, the extension falls back to only including the URL
